## Reading

*How Learning Works*

- Chapter 7: Why Does Course Climate Matter for Student Learning?
- Chapter 8: How Do Students Become Self-Directed Learners?

## Discussion Questions

1\. What stood out to you from this week's reading? Think of things that made sense in light of your own experience, things you're not convinced of, or questions that you have.

### *How Learning Works*

#### Chapter 7: Why Does Course Climate Matter for Student Learning?

2\. How might The Carpentries Code of Conduct function in supporting an "explicitly centralizing" (p.167) classroom climate?

3\. Choose a strategy among those suggested on pages 177-186 that seems useful or essential to a Carpentries workshop. What factors might prevent an Instructor from effectively implementing this strategy? As a Trainer, how might you help?

#### Chapter 8: How Do Students Become Self-Directed Learners?

4\. Most of our learners have rich experience with metacognitive strategies, but may not automatically apply them to the content of our workshops or Instructor Training. Why do you think this is? How can we support our learners in transferring metacognitive skills appropriately?

5\. (Try not to skip this question.) Try making a concept map that links one or more of the strategies on p.200-211 to one or more practices that could be implemented in a workshop to support metacognition. What concepts did you connect? What relationships did you identify?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- The Carpentries Code of Conduct is one of many features that creates a positive classroom climate for Carpentries workshops.
- Instructor trainees will face challenges as they develop skill in teaching. As in Carpentries workshops, a core goal of our two-day training is to prepare them to encounter and surmount those challenges.
