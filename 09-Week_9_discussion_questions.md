## Discussion Questions

1\. What stood out to you from this week's reading? Think of things that made sense in light of your own experience, things you're not convinced of, or questions that you have.

### Instructor Training Curriculum

#### [Working With Your Team](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/21-management.html)

2\. How do *you* feel about the prospect of handling a Code of Conduct incident at an event? What questions do you have?

#### [Launches and Landings](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/23-introductions.html)

3\. Introductions often include a lot of mundane content. How can an introduction cultivate motivation (per our recommendations) while still conveying necessary information?

#### [Putting It Together](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/24-practices.html)

4\. Try the "Organize your knowledge" activity! Report back: what did you learn?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Introducing a workshop has an outsized impact on the overall experience of the workshop. In addition to emphasizing preparation, it can be helpful to encourage trainees to think about this as a teaching challenge.
- At the end of the workshop, we ask our trainees to take some time to organize some of the information they have learned. This is also a useful exercise to practice when preparing to teach the workshop!
