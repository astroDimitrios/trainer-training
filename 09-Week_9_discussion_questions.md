## Discussion Questions

1. What stood out to you from this week's reading? Think of things that made sense in light of your own experience, things you're not convinced of, or questions that you have.

1. Not all trainees are interested in completing checkout for certification. Weâ€™re ok with that! What we worry about is when trainees who do want to certify are intimidated or deterred by some part of the process. What role can a Trainer play in supporting or encouraging trainees who want to complete the checkout process?

1. What questions do you have about policies and procedures for running a workshop? Where do you think trainees might find this information confusing or unclear?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Introducing a workshop has an outsized impact on the overall experience of the workshop. In addition to emphasizing preparation, it can be helpful to encourage trainees to think about this as a teaching challenge.
- At the end of the workshop, we ask our trainees to take some time to organize some of the information they have learned. This is also a useful exercise to practice when preparing to teach the workshop!
