## Discussion Questions

1. What stood out to you from this week's reading? Think of things that made sense in light of your own experience, things you're not convinced of, or questions that you have.

1. What content do you think might be missing from the Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility episode that would be important for our Instructors to understand in the context of Carpentries workshops?

1. Try to identify one opportunity for interaction with learners during the Welcome episode. How might you use this to establish a positive learning environment without running out the clock?

1. How might The Carpentries Code of Conduct function in supporting an “explicitly centralizing” (p.167) classroom climate?

1. Choose a strategy among those suggested on pages 177-186 that seems useful or essential to a Carpentries workshop. What factors might prevent an Instructor from effectively implementing this strategy? As a Trainer, how might you help?


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Thinking critically about Bloom's Taxonomy is typically beyond the Blooms' level we can expect Instructor trainees to perform at. Examine *your* learning objectives carefully to calibrate your expectations for this episode and meet learners where they are.
- Instructors are unlikely to face a Code of Conduct violation, but need to know what to do if this occurs. Reassurance of team support and clear instructions on reporting are the most important elements to communicate.
- Trainees may be intimidated by many elements of checkout. It is important to emphasize that teaching demonstrations are a friendly opportunity to give and receive feedback, not a high-stakes test, and that our Core Team is there to support them with any questions they may have during the checkout process.
- Participatory live coding keeps participants engaged, generates immediate feedback, and creates opportunities to model a healthy response to error. These features explicitly support learning and motivation.
- With instructional support, repeated practice and feedback can lead trainees to examine the component skills of teaching.
