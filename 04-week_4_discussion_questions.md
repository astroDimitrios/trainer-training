## Discussion Questions

1. What stood out to you from this week's reading? Think of things that made sense in light of your own experience, things you're not convinced of, or questions that you have.

1. Many of our curricula contain more content than can be covered in our ‘2-day’ format. How can we help our trainees remember to keep it slow and resist the urge to ‘get through’ everything by talking faster?

1. What expert awareness gaps might you have on the subject of teaching or learning? How might such gaps become apparent when teaching others how to teach?

1. How might “blind spots” (now re-named in our curriculum as “expert awareness gaps”) and cognitive load affect learners during Instructor Training? What about Trainers?

1. How can we help learners bridge the gap between learning and application? Is this different for Instructor Training vs Carpentries workshops?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- The cognitive level of a task is directly related to the action expected from learners -- not the complexity of the material or the stage of a workflow. Bloom's Taxonomy and associated verb charts are useful tools for evaluating the level of cognition required.
- Exercises and other classroom practices that keep learners actively engaged can provide many small opportunities for practice and feedback.
- Co-Instructors and co-Trainers can have a different perspective on instruction compared with learners, but we do not have a systematic way of collecting this feedback. A little advance planning and communication can help ease the awkwardness of sharing between peers.
