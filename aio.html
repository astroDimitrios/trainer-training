‘sciences’ to intersect? Where might they be different?</p>

are too soft or too hard? In education, programming, or other areas?</p>

<p>5. This book is organized around seven principles for teaching. Share
an example of how you’ve seen one of these principles influence
learners’ experience.</p>
<p>6. In our discussions, we will often move between levels in the
diagram below. We will apply the 7 principles to <em>teaching about how
to teach</em> (in instructor training) as well as <em>teaching technical
skills</em> (in a Carpentries workshop). We’ll even talk about
<em>learning how to teach teaching</em> in your role as a Trainer! Do
the 7 principles apply equally well to all of these contexts? Are there
any important differences to keep in mind?</p>

<p>This program is an on-boarding course designed to support Carpentries
community-members in preparing to teach Instructor Training courses. It
is not a substitute for Instructor Training; in contrast, this training
includes fewer contact hours and more independent work time stretched
over a 10 week period.</p>
<p>Each participant brings a different skill set to this training. Most
trainees have background in educational settings and/or experience
teaching Carpentries-style workshops. Trainees who are new to both
should plan to invest extra effort in the readings. All trainees, and
particularly those new to the community, are expected to seek continuing

<p>In addition to attending weekly meetings, there are additional
requirements for Trainer certification. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Observe a teaching demonstration session</li>
<li>Observe (with option to participate) 4 hours of an Instructor
Training course</li>
<li>Trainees who are not certified Carpentries Instructors should
complete Instructor certification concurrently. This includes attending
a full Instructor Training course as a learner if not yet attended.
Attending a course or demo within the training time frame can fulfill
the above requirements for observation if requested.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Each week, we will discuss assigned readings. Discussion questions
are provided to offer a framework for reading and conversation; these
should be completed or at least thought through before each meeting. If
you need to miss a meeting, questions may be submitted by email or by
adding responses to the Etherpad to enrich your group’s conversation.
When we meet we will always begin with a discussion of the first
question about trainee perspectives and interests, facilitated by your
host. Discussion may at times digress from the discussion questions, and
we will usually will not have time to talk about all questions during
our 1 hour meeting slots.</p>
<p>At sessions 2-9, one participant will play each of the following
roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Lead:</strong> assumes the Zoom “host” role and faciliates
conversation after discussion of the first question has concluded.
Importantly, the lead selects from remaining Discussion questions in the
curriculum, choosing which to use first, and which to cut if they wish
to spend more time on a particular topic. Leads should consider
experimenting with structure, e.g. using breakout rooms or other
facilitation strategies as desired. This is a great place to get
feedback on a method you’d like to try! The Lead role is
<strong>not</strong> about being an authority, but rather is an
opportunity to practice guiding discussion – a skill you will use when
you teach Instructor Training. Your host will be available to help out
as needed. If you use breakouts, you can decide if you wish to join a
group or discuss faciliatation strategies with your host during the
breakout time.</li>
<li>
<strong>Notes:</strong> takes notes on conversation in the
collaborative document (Etherpad or Google Doc) for the session. We do
not need perfect notes! In fact, lengthy notes can be hard to read. The
goal is to create a basic record we can use, e.g. to refresh a prior
conversation, review a missed meeting, or see what the other group
talked about. It is ok to ask a speaker to make corrections if you feel
something important was missed.</li>
<li>
<strong>Questioner:</strong> The Questioner strives to identify
questions, concerns, or points of confusion that trainees might have.
The person assigned to this role has a responsibility to set aside time
to think about possible questions, but this is a role that everyone
should strive to help out with. The person in the Questioner role is
also asked to serve as a backup note-taker, which means paying attention
to times when the notetaker is speaking or has to step away.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your host will provide you with a proposed schedule for these roles
for the full term. If it is impossible or impractical for you to play a
role on any week assigned to you, please let your host know
immediately.</p>

<p>Most of our Instructor Training events are taught online, via Zoom.
When circumstances permit, some Member organisations also host events
in- person. All events must have a least 2 Trainers in attendance. New
trainees should plan to be available for teaching assignments as soon as
certification is complete. New Trainers will be matched with experienced
Trainers whenever possible. New trainees are also welcome to request a
role as a third trainer to reduce the teaching load and enhance
observation opportunities during their first training.</p>

<p><a href="https://carpentries.org/trainers/" class="external-link">Trainers</a> meet monthly
for calls at 2 different time slots to accommodate global time zones.
Attending these calls his highly recommended (trainees are welcome!),
and all Trainers are asked to review meeting notes when they are unable
to attend, as important information and updates are shared there.
Regular meeting times are on the first Thursday of the month; however,
we keep a ‘placeholder’ slot on the calendar for the 3rd week of the
month. The placeholder can be used for special events or non-routine
discussions, and is also a substitute time when the first week falls
during a holiday. All meetings can be found on the <a href="https://carpentries.org/community/#community-events" class="external-link">Community

<p>Trainers also communicate asynchronously via Topicbox listserv,
Slack, and GitHub. New trainees will be invited to join the Topicbox
list early in their training, and will also be added to the #trainers

</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, the Trainer community consisted of a handful of
people who met twice monthly: once to discuss training events, and once
to make decisions about community business. As our community grew,
decision-making became more complex, often falling to a handful of
people with time to invest, or to The Carpentries Core Team. This system
did not ensure that the interests of all Trainers were adequately
addressed in decisions.</p>
<p>In 2020, some of these active participants were recruited to draft a
new governance structure for the Trainer community, and in 2021 our
first elections were held. The Trainers Leadership group meets 1-2 times
per month, consults with Core Team on matters of interest to Trainers,
and proposes changes to management of our curriculum and community to
make it more welcoming, fun, and sustainable.</p>
<p>New Trainers are an important voice to represent in Leadership,
because they have a fresh perspective on the challenges faced by
newcomers. This role is available to all participants, not only those
with extra time to share: we suggest that people serving in this role
consider reducing their other service activities in the community to
compensate during their tenure. The period of service is 1 year.</p>

</h3>
<p>Trainers are a vital part of The Carpentries community. In addition
to training Instructors and supporting the collaborative maintenance of
our Instructor Training curriculum, Trainers typically take on
leadership roles in their own communities, locally or globally. Many
assume leadership within the Trainer community, but all are expected to
contribute by coming to meetings and/or sharing thoughts or feedback in
other ways. Whatever your plans, don’t wait to get involved! If you see
a typo in the curriculum, try out a pull request to fix it, or ask
around to learn how. If you wonder if a section could be better, search
the repository for existing issues on the subject, and add your voice to
the conversation or start a new issue for us to work through during our
next update. If you have time, consider joining Trainer meetings
now!</p>

taken a Carpentries workshop?</p>
<p>5. Take a look at the strategies for ways Instructors can assess and
enhance their own knowledge organization at the end of Chapter 2
(p. 59-65). Choose one strategy and think about how an Instructor could
apply it when preparing to teach a Carpentries workshop. On a scale from
1-10, how challenging do you think it would be for a new Instructor to
use?</p>

<p>3. This chapter discusses the importance of creating good
opportunities for practice. In the context of a Carpentries workshop,
what role can an Instructor play in this regard? A helper?</p>
<p>4. Feedback is an essential component of effective practice. In what
ways do learners in a workshop get feedback on their progress? Is that
feedback likely to meet the criteria for <em>useful</em> feedback
outlined in this chapter? Why or why not?</p>
<p>5. In both Instructor Training and workshops, Carpentries surveys
provide feedback from learners, and additional feedback mechanisms
(e.g. minute cards and one-up-one-down) supplement this for a rich
source of information. Do you think there is any additional advantage in
asking a co-Instructor or co-Trainer for feedback? Why or why not? If
so, how would you go about seeking such feedback?</p>

engaged can provide many small opportunities for practice and
feedback.</li>

instruction compared with learners, but we do not have a systematic way

an “explicitly centralizing”(p.171-172) classroom climate?</p>

seems useful or essential to a Carpentries workshop. What factors might
prevent an Instructor from effectively implementing this strategy? As a

<p>4. Most of our learners have rich experience with metacognitive
strategies, but may not automatically apply them to the content of our
workshops or Instructor Training. Why do you think this is? How can we
support our learners in transferring metacognitive skills
appropriately?</p>
<p>5. (Try not to skip this question.) Try making a concept map that
links one or more of the strategies on p.203-215 to one or more
practices that could be implemented in a workshop to support
metacognition. What concepts did you connect? What relationships did you
identify?</p>

<p>2. This module introduces the Instructor Training event. Depending on
how Trainers use the curriculum, this section can be more or less
interactive and can take more or less time than it is formally
allocated. This is especially important when trainings get off to a slow
start for logistical reasons. Try to identify one opportunity for
interaction with learners during this episode. How might you use this to
establish a positive learning environment without running out the
clock?</p>

<p>6. This episode explains why we should teach slowly and allow time
for practice. However, many of our curricula contain more content than
can sometimes be covered in our ‘2-day’ format. How can we help our

everything by talking faster?</p>

<p>2. Reponses to Carpentries pre- and post- surveys are intended to be
useful to Instructors, Hosts, and The Carpentries. In particular, we
aspire to using data from these surveys to improve understanding of the
functionality of our programming as well as promote our successes and
needs to funders. This is critical to the sustainability of The
Carpentries overall. However, this requires that surveys be
systematically administered. Nobody <em>likes</em> surveys, and it’s not
fun to hound people to take them, either. What can we do to persuade
Instructors to make more consistent use of these important assessment
tools? (Responses might include ways to make the surveys themselves more
useful.)</p>

<p>3. Avoiding demotivating learners is at least as important as
motivating them, but there are many demotivating “traps” an instructor
can fall into even when they are aware of the problem. What strategies
can we give our instructors for recovering from these slip-ups?</p>

<p>6. When trainees give feedback, especially when giving feedback to
themselves, they are VERY likely to comment on the number of times they
said “um” or “uh” during their practice presentation. How would you go
about helping them to level up their feedback to address more impactful

<li>Convincing trainees to collect feedback is a fundamental goal.
Teaching them to use it is the next step.</li>
<li>Developing awareness of demotivating scenarios is a fundamental
goal. Teaching trainees to cope with them is the next step.</li>
<li>Many trainees may have a growth mindset with regard to computational
skills and a fixed mindset with regard to teaching skills.</li>
<li>New Instructors should start their improvement process with ‘low
hanging fruit’ – teaching techniques they can easily adopt. For some,
this might center on presentation style while for others, it might have
more to do with classroom mechanics. Focusing on one thing at a time to
improve on can help people evaluate and prioritize their goals as they
progress.</li>

<p>5. The exercise on <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/18-preparation#evaluate-learning-objectives" class="external-link">evaluating
learning objectives</a> still needs work. The goal is to get learners a)
looking at learning objectives critically and b) thinking in levels
<em>like</em> Bloom’s Taxonomy without actually introducing the jargon
and complexities of the Bloom’s model. In practice, however, learners
are very prone to thinking in terms of <strong>steps</strong> rather
than <strong>levels</strong> of cognitive challenge. Can you think of a
change to this exercise, or a different exercise entirely, that might be
more effective?</p>

need to know what to do if this occurs. Reassurance of team support and
clear instructions on reporting are the most important elements to
communicate.</li>
<li>Trainees may be intimidated by many elements of checkout. It is
important to emphasize that teaching demonstrations are a friendly
opportunity to give and receive feedback, not a high-stakes test, and
that our Core Team is there to support them with any questions they may

<li>Participatory live coding keeps participants engaged, generates
immediate feedback, and creates opportunities to model a healthy

    2022-11-07: we have gotten a notification that we have an overage for our
    tracking and I'm pretty sure this has to do with Workbench usage.
    Considering that I am not _currently_ using this tracking because I do not
    yet know how to access the data, I am turning this off for now.
  <script>
    var _paq = window._paq = window._paq || [];
    /* tracker methods like "setCustomDimension" should be called before "trackPageView" */
    _paq.push(["setDocumentTitle", document.domain + "/" + document.title]);
    _paq.push(["setDomains", ["*.preview.carpentries.org","*.datacarpentry.github.io","*.datacarpentry.org","*.librarycarpentry.github.io","*.librarycarpentry.org","*.swcarpentry.github.io", "*.carpentries.github.io"]]);
    _paq.push(["setDoNotTrack", true]);
    _paq.push(["disableCookies"]);
    _paq.push(['trackPageView']);
    _paq.push(['enableLinkTracking']);
    (function() {
          var u="https://carpentries.matomo.cloud/";
          _paq.push(['setTrackerUrl', u+'matomo.php']);
          _paq.push(['setSiteId', '1']);
          var d=document, g=d.createElement('script'), s=d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
          g.async=true; g.src='https://cdn.matomo.cloud/carpentries.matomo.cloud/matomo.js'; s.parentNode.insertBefore(g,s);
        })();
