::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Propose one way to support learner interaction early in a workshop even when pressed for time.
- Apply a concept map to illustrate the importance of explicit connections in knowledge and learning.
- Distinguish challenges related to skill level faced by learners from those faced by Instructors.
- Predict challenges posed by expert awareness gaps in the context of teaching Instructors how to teach.
- Propose a strategy to support Instructor trainees in implementing guidance on pacing in spite of competing priorities related to content and time.

* Chapter 6: What Kinds of Practice and Feedback Enhance Learning? (p. 130 - 161)

From The Carpentries [Instructor Training curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/instructor/index.html):

## Discussion Questions

1. What stood out to you from this week's reading? Think of things that made sense in light of your own experience, things you're not convinced of, or questions that you have.

1. When trainees give feedback, especially when giving feedback to themselves, they are VERY likely to comment on the number of times they said “um” or “uh” during their practice presentation. How would you go about helping them to level up their feedback to address more impactful features?

1. Responses to Carpentries pre- and post- surveys are intended to be useful to Instructors, Hosts, and The Carpentries. In particular, we aspire to using data from these surveys to improve understanding of the functionality of our programming as well as promote our successes and needs to funders. This is critical to the sustainability of The Carpentries overall. However, this requires that surveys be systematically administered. Nobody likes surveys, and it’s not fun to hound people to take them, either. What can we do to persuade Instructors to make more consistent use of these important assessment tools? (Responses might include ways to make the surveys themselves more useful.)

1. In the context of a Carpentries workshop, what role does an Instructor play in creating opportunities for practice? What role does a helper play?

1. In what ways do learners in a workshop get feedback on their progress? Is that feedback likely to meet the criteria for useful feedback outlined in this chapter? Why or why not?

1. In both Instructor Training and workshops, Carpentries surveys provide feedback from learners, and additional feedback mechanisms (e.g. minute cards and one-up-one-down) supplement this for a rich source of information. Do you think there is any additional advantage in asking a co-Instructor or co-Trainer for feedback? Why or why not? If so, how would you go about seeking such feedback?


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- The Carpentries Instructor Training curriculum offers many opportunities to model, as well as to teach, good practices.
- Skill acquisition models explain challenges faced by learners and Instructors, Instructor trainees and Trainers.
- Expert teachers may have filled in awareness gaps in subjects they teach, but may still have gaps on the subject of teaching.
- Going slowly is a challenge that takes constant effort and compromise.
- There are many approaches and supporting documents available to teach Instructor Training. Many of these are referenced in the Instructor Notes.
